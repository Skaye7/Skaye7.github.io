I was on the Traditions Committee in the 2024-2025 year.
The Traditions Committee Plans multi-day events each quarter that promote and strengthen the traditions of DU:
1. Hockey Night Lights (Fall Quarter)
2. Winter Carnival (Winter Quarter)
3. May Days (Spring Quarter)

During the 2025-2026 year, I will be a Co-Chair for the MainStage Committee!
MainStage programs at least one concert or entertainment-focused event per quarter.
They always do the following Events:
1. Battle of the Bands (Winter Quarter)
2. MusicFest (Spring Quarter)

At the DUPB Banquet on May 4, 2025, I won 5 awards. Here are some photos:

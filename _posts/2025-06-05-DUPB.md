I was on the Traditions Committee in the 2024-2025 year
The Traditions Committee Plans multi-day events each quarter that promote and strengthen the traditions of DU:
1. Hockey Night Lights (Fall Quarter)
2. Winter Carnival (Winter Quarter)
3. May Days (Spring Quarter

At the DUPB Banquet on May 4, 2025, I won 5 awards. Here are some photos:
